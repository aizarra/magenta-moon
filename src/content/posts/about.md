I am Anna Fisher, astronaut and pioneer in space exploration.

With a career spanning over four decades, I've dedicated myself to pushing the boundaries of human achievement. 

Joining NASA in 1978 as one of the agency's first female astronauts, I made history in 1984 as the first mother in space aboard the Space Shuttle Discovery. 

My contributions to science and engineering have been invaluable, from developing tools for spacewalks to conducting groundbreaking research on human adaptation to weightlessness. 

Beyond my stellar career as an astronaut, I'm also a trained emergency physician, showcasing my commitment to both space exploration and medical science. 

My passion for discovery and my unwavering dedication to advancing our understanding of the universe continue to inspire generations of aspiring astronauts and scientists worldwide.
